# Excel_KPI_Dashboard
A project that utilizes Microsoft Excel to create KPIs and visualize KPIs vs Actual Sale's Adidas data through an interactive dashboard.
# Problem Description
We have obtained the actual sales dataset of Adidas on Kangle and research for KPIs. We proceeded to clean the data (changing data types, removing unnecessary data, etc.) and created a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) for Adidas's sales department. From there, we established specific KPIs. Our ultimate goal is to visualize KPIs and actual sales of Adidas using Excel.
